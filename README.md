The purpose of this repository is to provide tools to batch download images in the `citizensciencewater.appspot.com` Cloud Storage bucket.

To use it, you must obtain a service account JSON file with at least Storage Object Viewer permissions.

Download that file, call it `storage-reader-service-account.json`, and place it in the cloned repository.

From there, you need to have Python 3+ (python.org if you do not!) installed, with the `pip3` and `python3` commands working on your path.

With python 3 setup, run `bash setup.sh` to set up the tools.

Instructions for use will be printed once setup is complete.
